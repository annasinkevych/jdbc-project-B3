-- IQ: What is the difference between DROP, DELETE, TRUNCATE
-- DROP COLUMN - removes the whole Column
-- DELETE  ----- removes the whole ROW based on the WHERE CONDITION
-- TRUNCATE TABLE ---- will remove all the data row from the table but table structure is still there
-- DROP TABLE ----- will delete whole database table including structure
